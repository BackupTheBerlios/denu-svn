Bugs.

-button to create a copy of an entry to drag somewhere else. For instance, I 
like having an entry for my main xterm, browser, irc client, etc. in both the 
root menu and under the corresponding submenu alongside similar programs...

-programable button in the main program window that generates configs en masse 
for select WM/DEs with 1-click. For instance, this could be the current 
"generate" button and a new button could be added that lists all WM/DEs with a 
checkbox next to them that gets saved.

From Gherald on the gentoo forum.

It would be nice if root could generate a menu and make it the default menu
people recieve.  ie set the equivalent of /etc/skel/ for the menus so that when
users log in they already can benefit from the tool you provide without needed 
to know anything about it even existing.  I am sure that gnome,kde,etc keep a 
default menu somewhere, if root could over write it with a new, better, 
customized menu that would be great. (and speed my time as an admin substantially).

Berlios feature request.
