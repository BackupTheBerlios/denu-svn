-button to create a copy of an entry to drag somewhere else. For instance, I 
like having an entry for my main xterm, browser, irc client, etc. in both the 
root menu and under the corresponding submenu alongside similar programs...

-programable button in the main program window that generates configs en masse 
for select WM/DEs with 1-click. For instance, this could be the current 
"generate" button and a new button could be added that lists all WM/DEs with a 
checkbox next to them that gets saved.

It would be nice if root could generate a menu and make it the default menu
people recieve.  ie set the equivalent of /etc/skel/ for the menus so that when
users log in they already can benefit from the tool you provide without needed 
to know anything about it even existing.  I am sure that gnome,kde,etc keep a 
default menu somewhere, if root could over write it with a new, better, 
customized menu that would be great. (and speed my time as an admin substantially).

It would be nice for denu to also generate WindowMaker compatible menus as this 
would add yet another supported window manager to your list of popular windowing
systems
