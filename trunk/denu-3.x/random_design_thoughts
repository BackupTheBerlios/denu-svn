With denu 3.x in full use 3 trees will exist.  One will be the menu, another the
installed programs and the third a container for all custom entries.  The third 
container will hold custom program entries in addition to 'specials'.  In the 
file system these custom entries will reside as individual files.  This is for 
the purpose of trading/transferring entries from one system to another.
