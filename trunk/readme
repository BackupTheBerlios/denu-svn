This is a simple readme.
I, Scott Shawcroft (Shux) created Denu.  It is released under the GPL2 license.
My email is shux_linux@comcast.net if you have any urgent questions.
Now for a few random things.
If nothing is in the installed box click Update and Sysupdate.
Sorry for being criptic and everything else.  Expect some documentation soon.
     
For KDE support:
     1)Install KDE.
     2) Add '<MergeFile>denu.menu</MergeFile>' in ~/.config/menus/applications-kmenuedit.menu 
		before the last '</Menu>'
